    "## üìö Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data was sourced from [Lichess PGN database](https://database.lichess.org/), which provides large-scale collections of chess games. I used February 2025 data games.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure high-quality examples, we applied the following filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both players must be rated **above 2400**.\n",
    "- Games must be **at least 5 minutes per side** to exclude low-effort blitz games.\n",
    "\n",
    "This filtering process yielded:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **22,596 games**\n",
    "- **2,370,238 board positions**\n",
    "- Positions are divided into **23 shards** (shards 0‚Äì22), each containing exactly **1,000 games** and weighing **~500‚Äì700MB** after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßπ Data Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Scripts `pgn_filtering.py` and `pgn_time_filtering.py` were used to apply rating and time controls filters to raw PGN files. The `pgn` shards in data/shards300_small are already filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parsing**:\n",
    "   - `position_parsing.py` converts filtered PGN games into a structured batch format:\n",
    "     - Board input tensors\n",
    "     - Labels for move targets, evaluation result, in-check flag, threats, etc.\n",
    "     - All the tensors are saved in `int8` or `uint8` type to improve efficiency.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Packaging**:\n",
    "   - `convert_to_stacked_shards.py` collects and compresses parsed batches into final `.pt` tensor files.\n",
    "   - This significantly accelerates data loading during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each shard in its final form contains all required inputs and targets for model training, allowing efficient streaming from disk."
